# MLOps Basics Reproduction

This repository is a reproduction of the [graviraja-mlops-basics](https://github.com/graviraja/mlops-basics) repository, aimed at understanding and applying fundamental MLOps concepts.

## Goals

* Reproduce the project structure and functionality from the original repository.
* Gain hands-on experience with core MLOps tools and practices.
* Understand the workflow from project setup to model monitoring, deployment, and beyond.

## Planned Actions

1.  **Fork and Clone:**
    * Fork the original `graviraja-mlops-basics` repository.
    * Clone the forked repository to my local machine.

2.  **Environment Setup:**
    * Create a virtual environment (e.g., using `conda` or `venv`).
    * Install the required dependencies from each `requirements.txt` file.

3.  **Weekly Progression:**
    * Follow the weekly structure of the original repository.
    * For each week (Week 0 to Week 9):
        * Review the `README.md` and associated blog post to understand the concepts.
        * Execute the provided scripts (`train.py`, `inference.py`, etc.).
        * Run the experimental notebooks (`data_exploration.ipynb`) to explore the data and code.
        * Pay close attention to the configurations, DVC, Docker, GitHub Actions, and AWS deployments.
        * Test the API with postman or other API testing tools, after the docker image is running.
        * Test the AWS Lambada function.
        * Explore the kibana dashboards.
    * Document any issues, observations, or modifications made during the process.

4.  **Key Technologies:**
    * **Week 0:** Project Setup (PyTorch Lightning, Hugging Face Transformers)
    * **Week 1:** Model Monitoring (Weights & Biases)
    * **Week 2:** Configuration Management (Hydra)
    * **Week 3:** Data Versioning (DVC)
    * **Week 4:** Model Packaging (ONNX, ONNX Runtime)
    * **Week 5:** Containerization (Docker)
    * **Week 6:** CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
    * **Week 7:** Container Registry (AWS ECR)
    * **Week 8:** Serverless Deployment (AWS Lambda)
    * **Week 9:** Prediction Monitoring (Kibana, Cloudwatch, Elastic search)

5.  **Documentation:**
    * Maintain a log of the steps taken and any challenges encountered.
    * Document any modifications or improvements made to the code.

6.  **Learning Outcomes:**
    * Gain a practical understanding of MLOps workflows.
    * Become proficient in using the tools mentioned above.
    * Develop the ability to set up, monitor, deploy, and maintain machine learning models.
